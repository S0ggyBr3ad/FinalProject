Project Summary:
	This project aims to bring a deeper understanding of how sound and reverberation work. This program incorporates tools to calculate the reverberation time of sound in audio files, as well as to help visualize the data gathered from the uploaded files. 

Project Features:

    #1. Data cleaning and conversion:
        Our program will clean any wav file of metadata, as well as convert non-wav files to this format. Furthermore, any multichannel audio will be converted to single channel to improve analysis
    
    #2. Analysis & Visualization
        Our program will take in any audio file the user uploads, and calculate reverberation time as well as visualize it. The waveform of the audio will also be displayed, as well as a spectrogram of the sound.
    
    


Instructions:

	Uploading file: Simply use the 'Select File' button located on top of the program. This will open a file select prompt and ask you to select a .mp3 or .wav file
    
	Data Analysis: The sound file you upload will be handled by the program and the graph of your choosing will be displayed. To choose a graph, simply click one of the corresponding buttons under the name of the selected file.

	Switching Graphs: You will have the ability to change the displayed graph. This can be simply done by clicking the button corresponding to a graph different than that you have selected.
